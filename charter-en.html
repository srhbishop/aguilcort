            Our struggle for independence was a milestone that symbolizes the multi-ethnic and multicultural coexistence of our people, where our differences served as a reason for unity and complementarity around the achievement of our freedom and self-determination as a people.
            <br>
            <br>
            This fact allowed us to affirm our Guinean nationality, enabled the recognition of our national identity in the international forum. This union of heterogeneity was a decisive factor for many successes that the country has achieved throughout its history.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, during a recent period of our journey, more precisely with the advent of democracy, this agglutinating element felt and still feels threatened, with some harmful attitudes and practices on the part of some citizens.
            <br>
            <br>
            During democracy we can watch the use of ethnic identity factor as a decoy to obtain votes and the use of this factor as the justification for some acts that were not achieved during the governance or our behavior.
            Now, in the face of these disturbing signs that could undermine national unity, the most robust achievement of our people, we feel, as young people and tomorrow's future, that we must roll up our sleeves and try to keep this ethnic unity intact and consequently our identity. 
            <br>
            <br>
            To give substance to this initiative, a group of young people moved by the feeling described above and joined on <strong>AGUILCORT</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The creation of this brilliant sun that aims to illuminate the way of Guineans to guide their behaviors and attitudes in the best practices of human coexistence, under the sacred mantle that is our union. Always keeping the spirit of Guinea alive, the reason and the foundation of the creation of this association.
            The truth of this beautiful boat lies in the attempt to lead Guinean citizens to a good port. Which means the union of all Guineans, without any tribal or ethnic prejudice.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>AGUILCORT</strong> appeared to contribute to the reactivation of good cultural values ​​and in the awareness of ethnic groups for their practice, as they seem to be gradually losing themselves in the country. It is also important to realign the appreciation and taste for our multicultural line, namely our songs, defined as of various styles, such as: Gumbé, Tina, Sicô, Nhanero, Cunderé, Balafón, Broska etc. because those values ​​and rituals that they are losing may be at risk of not being known by our children, if we do nothing to preserve them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many speak of ethnicities as an element of separation, without remembering that these constitute the factor of wealth and comparative advantage, since they identify us as Guineans from the same journey and the same destination or determine the name with which we liberate our beloved homeland therefore, we must not lose this value among ourselves;
            <br>
            <br>
            Speaking of Balanta, Papers, Fula, Mancanha, Mandinga; Manjaco yes, but only to allow us to know our roots, without which we do not understand the reason for our joining in the same territorial space called Guinea-Bissau and why we feel Guineans. We must never use an ethnic factor to divide or sow conflict between Guineans.
            <br>
            <br>
            If we contribute together to eradicate racism and tribalism in our country; what it means is that we must fight to unite around Guinea, we will have the future of our guaranteed land.
            It is driven by this desire that we are here before the country to announce our dedication to this cause of enormous virtue for national cohesion, an element without which any initiative leading to development is absolutely impossible.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>AGUILCORT</strong> is aware of the country's economic difficulties as well as the adversities of initiatives of this kind, however, the nobility of the cause drives our firmness in the struggle to achieve the results we propose.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is true that the journey will not be easy, so we are already launching a challenge to potential partners and people who share this idea to contribute to the extent of their possibilities and availability in order to make this dream that every day takes on the body of reality possible.

            <br>

This can only be achieved with the will and commitment of all of us, so we are sure that we can count on everyone's contribution to this project that today came out.
            <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, we would like to see this initiative endeared and appropriate by the entire Guinean population, but in particular by the state, through the support, partnerships and incentives that it can attribute to this national organization focused exclusively on fostering national unity and cohesion.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you for the presence of all and a well-being, because the country is above individual interests.
