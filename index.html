    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
        Aguilcort is a non-governmental organization founded in 2007 in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa. It was officially registered as an NGO on 02 March, 2011.
        <br>
        <br>
        Initiated by a group of young Bissau-Guineans and headed by Salifo Ntique Nhate, Aguilcort was formed out of concern for the ethnic divisions that Bissau-Guineans saw beginning to surface in their country. They founded Aguilcort for the purpose of fostering national unity and cooperation, celebrating Guinea-Bissau’s cultural and linguistic diversity, and providing community education and social support for women and children.

    <h2>Our Vision, Goals, and Objectives</h2>
    <p>
       Our vision is a multi-cultural and nationally-unified Guinea-Bissau that sees its ethnic diversity as an asset rather than a reason for division. Our vision is for all Bissau-Guineans to have autonomy and self-determination through the empowerment achieved through education, wealth, agribusiness, and social housing. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To contribute to our cultural development and respect the traditions of our land, so long as they do not go against human rights or dignities
        </li>
        <li>
            To organize and sponsor events for art, dance, music, and theatre
        </li>
        <li>
            To collect and preserve the traditional art and stories of our people
        </li>
        <li>
            To work against signs of sectarianism harmful to the people, including ethnic and religious discrimination
        </li>
        <li>
            To give special attention to our children, their development, and to protect them from abuse
        </li>
        <li>
            To advocate for women's rights
        </li>
        <li>
            To stand against violence
